# HanoiSolver
A simple python program that takes a start date and end date and outputs how many disks a tower of hanoi puzzle should have and the time for each step such that the puzzle will end at the specific date. 

This program is intended to give me some preliminary values for figuring out how best to construct a robot that will solve the tower of hanoi problem over a number of years, completing the puzzle on the day I am expected to die with my current life expectancy.
